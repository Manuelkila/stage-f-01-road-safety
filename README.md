# UK 2016 Road Safety Data
**Inspiration**

1. Are there patterns for accidents involving different road users?
2. Can we predict the safest / most dangerous times to travel
3. Can this data help route cyclists around accident hotspots taking into account the time of day, weather, route etc
4. Are certain cars more accident prone than others?


**Content**

There are 4 CSVs and an Excel file in this set. Accidents is the primary table and has references by Accident_Index to the other tables
